<h2>Plato</h2>
<p></p>
He is widely considered the pivotal figure in the history of Ancient Greek and Western philosophy,
along with his teacher, Socrates, and his most famous student, Aristotle. 
<p></p>Plato has also often been cited as one of the founders of Western religion and spirituality.
<p></p>The so-called Neoplatonism of philosophers like Plotinus and Porphyry greatly influenced Christianity through Church 
<p></p>Fathers such as Augustine. Alfred North Whitehead once noted: "the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato."
